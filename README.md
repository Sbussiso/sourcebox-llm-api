## SourceBox LLM API

<br/>
<br/>

> The SourceBox LLM API provides a powerful platform for managing, querying, and analyzing a wide variety of data and code packs using AI-based techniques. It allows users to upload structured data or code repositories, process them into vector embeddings, and perform in-depth queries using natural language or raw search modes. The platform leverages state-of-the-art tools such as OpenAI's GPT models, DeepLake for vector storage, and custom embeddings to support both document search and advanced code analysis.
